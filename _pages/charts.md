# Finding and Cleaning Data

Good starting points for finding data:

+ [Where to Find Data](https://github.com/amandabee/workshops/wiki/Where-to-Find-Data)

[Peter Aldhous](https://www.peteraldhous.com/) has some fantastic tips for getting creative in his [lesson plan](http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/week5.html) from his Data Visualization course.

[Mago Torres](https://www.magotorres.net/) has a few great stories about the benefit of a little creativity if you're working on an international story. If the US won't give you details of a meeting between US and Mexican officials, don't assume you can't get what you need from the Mexican government.

Quiz: what is the fastest way to reduce the number of murders in a single precinct?

<!-- Answer: start categorizing them as something else. -->


## Using Workbench to Clean Data

Peter Aldhous has a great walk through that will show you how to [use OpenRefine](http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/week5.html) to clean up data.

We're going to use Workbench, only because I think it does a nice job of providing an easy to read audit trail. The two tools aren't exactly interchangeable but knowing what is possible is the first step.

I replicated those data cleaning exercises so we can walk through them and explore Workbench. The first uses a CSV of data from the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=5&pid=53&aid=1&cid=regions,&syid=2000&eyid=2014&unit=TBPD) on regional oil production. The numbers given are thousands of barrels per day.

You can see my work at: <https://app.workbenchdata.com/workflows/5908/> but don't use "duplicate" -- we're going to walk through this from scratch.

1. Start by downloading the raw data from <http://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/data/week5.zip>

2. Create a new Workbench workflow and upload `oilproduction.csv` to it.

# Making Really Good Charts

# Homework, Due Thursday
Re-make the following chart in Datawrapper:

Pay attention not only to the data, but also to the framing.

Identify at least three data sources that you're interested in working with. One should be about places. Pull each into Workbench and make them Public. Share the URLs with me.
