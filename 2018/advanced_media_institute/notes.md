# Design Basics

We can talk about "good" design, or bad design but ...


Good Charts: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/02/08/ice-arrests-went-up-in-2017-with-biggest-increases-in-florida-northern-texas-oklahoma/

Bad charts: https://www.ice.gov/features/100-days

Starting with some basic questions: what does this chart show? 

What is 38%? 52%? What do those represent? 

What does the grey represent? 

What you do in a presentation is your business, but if you're writing, or charting, for public consumption, your goal is to highlight the numbers that matter and clarify them. It isn't to show everyone that you can do cool 3d things. 

FWIW, what the ICE chart is showing that toal arrests were up 37.6% in 2017. Convicted criminal arrests were up 18.2% and at-large arrests up 52.6% (their math is a little off).

Thc charts are also just inaccurate if you look at the Y-axis and compare that to the numbers.

	2016	2017	Percent Change
	Total Arrests	30028	41318	37.6%
	Convicted Criminals	25786	30473	18.2%
	At-Large Arrests	8381	12786	52.6%
