<p>You're going to discover fairly quickly that if you don't have an "index.html" in your repository, you just get a <code>404 File Not Found</code> error when you try to view your repository. </p>

<p>There are a few possible solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a file called "index.html"  or,</li>
<li>explicitly name the file you want to see, in your URL. </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, in my <a href="https://github.com/amandabee/workshops">workshops</a> repository, the <code>gh-pages</code> branch does not include a file called "index.html" so I get an error when I visit <a href="http://amandabee.github.io/workshops/">http://amandabee.github.io/workshops/</a>. I do have a file there called "urls.html", however, so this works just fine: <a href="http://amandabee.github.io/workshops/urls.html">http://amandabee.github.io/workshops/urls.html</a></p>
