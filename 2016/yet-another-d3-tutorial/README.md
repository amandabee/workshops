Many have come before, but this is mine. 

I'm working through my first real D3 project and I can't stop thinking like a teacher. So here's what we have:

# Color Array

My first project is a fairly basic [stacked column chart](http://www.verisi.com/resources/d3-tutorial-basic-charts.htm#s6), but while I was working on it I was having trouble troubleshooting because I couldn't even quite tell where it was breaking because I didn't know which color was meant to be which. So I thought I'd take a step back and see if I couldn't do something even more basic: color a row of rectangles using an array of hexidecimal codes. 

So, given an array like:

    var colors = ["#66c2a5", "#fc8d62", "#8da0cb", "#e78ac3", "#a6d854", "#ffd92f", "#e5c494", "#b3b3b3"];

How would you create a row of boxes?  Think it over, describe it, and then see if what you came up with looks anything like [what I came up with](color_array.html).

# Stacked Columns

I found a half dozen different examples and walk throughs.
