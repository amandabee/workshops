People say that Gulfton makes Harris County, Texas, (Houston) the most diverse
county in the U.S. -- though that depends on how you define diversity. [Queens, New York might have them beat](https://censusreporter.org/data/table/?table=B02001&geo_ids=05000US36081,05000US48201), but Gulfton is the densest neighborhood Texas.

Lots of maps in here. I like the one on numbered page 21 (.pdf page 16)

Case Study:
Sometimes a map is [so dense that it's useless](https://cdan.nhtsa.gov/GISMaps/STSI_MAP_Mobile.htm?1&USA&VAR1=1&41&-99&34,247&34,748&32,538&5).

## Discussion: do these charts work? Do you want more?

### For a future lesson plan?

[TRAC looks at ICE detention](https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/530/) -- most people detained by ICE haven't been convicted of a crime, and when they have been convicted it was often a relatively minor crime.

CalMatters ran a commentary arguing that the [corporation tax shouldn't be increased](https://calmatters.org/articles/commentary/california-corporate-tax/). His chart was interesting to me because it didn't provide any context.

Â» *Question:* What context is missing here?

We could adjust for inflation, or compare to the state economy as a whole.

I wanted to track down the data itself, so I looked at his sources. [NBER publishes data on recessions](https://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html).
