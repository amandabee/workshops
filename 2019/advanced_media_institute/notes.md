Data visualization doesn't have to be data driven. This chart of [QZ Brexit paths](https://qz.com/1571189/what-happens-now-that-theresa-may-lost-her-brexit-deal-vote/) helps tell a chutes-and-ladders like story.

Often charts are relatively simple. CalMatters ran a long report on [families struggling to get mental health care](https://calmatters.org/articles/californians-struggle-to-get-mental-health-care/) and included a couple of charts.

The Intercept dug into data on [terrorism prosecutions](https://trial-and-terror.theintercept.com/) in the US and looked at [sexual abuse of prisoners in ICE custody](https://theintercept.com/2018/04/11/immigration-detention-sexual-abuse-ice-dhs/). Both took some substantial digging.




## Discussion: do these charts work? Do you want more?

### For a future lesson plan?

[TRAC looks at ICE detention](https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/reports/530/) -- most people detained by ICE haven't been convicted of a crime, and when they have been convicted it was often a relatively minor crime.

CalMatters ran a commentary arguing that the [corporation tax shouldn't be increased](https://calmatters.org/articles/commentary/california-corporate-tax/). His chart was interesting to me because it didn't provide any context.

Â» *Question:* What context is missing here?

We could adjust for inflation, or compare to the state economy as a whole.

I wanted to track down the data itself, so I looked at his sources. [NBER publishes data on recessions](https://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html).

Sharon Lerner and Moiz Syed collaborated on a project looking at [drinking water contamination from firefighting foam](https://theintercept.com/2015/12/16/toxic-firefighting-foam-has-contaminated-u-s-drinking-water-with-pfcs/).

USA Today mapped [maternal mortality](https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/investigations/deadly-deliveries/2019/03/07/maternal-death-rates-secret-hospital-safety-records-childbirth-deaths/2953224002/) across the US.
