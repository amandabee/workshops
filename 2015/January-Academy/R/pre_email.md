I'm looking forward to digging into R with you on Thursday! If you haven't already, please do go make sure to instal [RStudio Desktop](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desk) on the machine you'll have for the workshop. Please actually *open* it to confirm that the installation is complete. 

And if you have a few extra moments, I'd love to hear from you before Thursday -- is there data that has captured your attention? Or are you just hoping get get stronger with data in general? 

See you Thursday,
Amanda
