# Intor to R for Data 

Thurs., Jan. 22, 9:30 a.m.-12:30 p.m.  
Room 436 (14 students max)  

> If you plan to crunch data, you will outgrow Excel, which is when smart reporters turn to R, a powerful statistical analysis and programming language that can process much larger volumes of data than a spreadsheet. We'll walk through the process of opening and summarizing a data set in R, and we'll look at good places to get help when you get stuck. You won’t leave this workshop an expert, but you’ll have enough of a foundation that you can tackle bigger data analysis challenges with the help of the R documentation. The workshop will be taught by Amanda Hickman, who has used R for projects she simply couldn't have completed otherwise. Prerequisites: You should be comfortable filtering and writing simple formulas in Excel or Calc, to get the most out of our workshop. We’ll use R through RStudio’s excellent interface, so please come with RStudio installed on your laptop.

#Introduction 
R is an incredibly powerful free and open source programming language for statistical computing and graphics. If you've ever used SPSS or Stata, you know what "real stats software" can do. R, too, is real stats software. 

I had been wanting to try it out for a while when Amanda Aronczyk called me for help on a story she was reporing for Marketplace -- she needed help analyzing hundreds of thousands of rows of data about people who owe money to they Philadelphia court system ([Philadelphia collects court debt decades later](http://www.marketplace.org/topics/wealth-poverty/philadelphia-collects-court-debt-decades-later)). It looked like the perfect place to start learning. I am still feeling my way around R, but there's no question that it's a great tool for good-sized data projects. 

## Requirements
Before our workshop, you should have already installed R, and [RStudio Desktop](http://www.rstudio.com/). Trust me. Using R without a good IDE is no fun at all. RStudio is a great IDE. 

## Finding your way around
We're going to use the IDE as best we can, so everyone should start a new R file, call it jan_academy.R -- I'll show you how to "Run" each line and see your work. Why `jan_academy.R` and not `Jan Academy` or `JanAcademy.r` or, really anything else? Because of [reasons](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Rguide.xml). In all seriousness, coding style helps ensure that other folks can read your work . 

` <- ` means "gets" so you'd read `SomeTable <- read(somefile.csv)` as "SomeTable gets read parens somefile.csv close-parens " 
 
 


# Keep Learning:
I can't recommend [Nathan Yau's tutorials](http://flowingdata.com/) highly enough. They're worth paying for.
