## Intros -- 10 Min
Who we are. We should just be transparent that we're new to working together so we're still learning a bit about how we each think.

## How Journalists are Using Data -- 30 min 
Amanda will put a deck together. We can hand the mic back and forth as there are things we want to add. 
Examples of charts and data-driven stories. 

### Making pretty charts is easy (Amanda) -- 15 Minutes
Maybe just take some Fred data and put it into a nicer Chart? Even the data Krugman uses? Just to start with the simplest thing. 
### Transformation 1 (Bui) 30-45 minutes
Index Data -- pull time series data, index it w/in Fred, index it in Excel
Register. Make sure users save data. Then give the option to go back and
try other transformations.
Bui will show year-on-year and 3 month moving average smoothing in Fred
Bui will make an example spreadsheet
More good examples of visualizations of similar data/or that use data transformed in this way.
### Transformation 2 (Both) 30-45 minutes
Pivot (Amanda) and then Over/Under Average (Bui)
* Use the state average and over/under -- with Gas Wells
More good examples of visualizations of similar data/or that use data transformed in this way.
### Extra
-Take a RAW SVG into Illustrator (Bui)
-ACS (Bui). Think of a fun question. 
-CartoDB (Amanda)
Possible data to work with: 
+ NY State budget data, Citizens Budget Commission, Nat'l Assn of State Budget Officers
+ Medicaid as a percent of the whole budget, state by state
Homework
