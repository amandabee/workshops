[Tacoma Budget](http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/10/07/3420458/tacomas-proposed-two-year-budget.html) -- she does a lot of combing through the budget but not a lot of charting or comparing. 

[Stadium Way projects costs increase again](http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/08/19/3338036/stadium-way-project-costs-increase.html) -- follows the slow tacking on of dollars to one project. 

[Library cuts](http://www.thenewstribune.com/2014/10/28/3457144/tacoma-library-budget-would-cut.html) -- tracks impact of budget on library staffing.

Dan Keating at the Washington Post has beaten up the DC municipal budget

Not budget, but interesting:

He's got some items ready for the wall of shame, too:

Fails my rules: 
1) Have a clear takeaway. Even if the framing is "by the numbers" tell me what I'm leaving with.

[Open Budget Oakland](http://openbudgetoakland.org./2013-2015-adopted-budget.html#FY14-15.Expense.General%20Fund:%20General%20Purpose)
There's some interesting stuff here, though it fails my journalism test (you need to find the story and tell me what it is. Hmph.)
A similar viz from Gothamist: [NYC Budget Breakdown](http://gothamist.com/2013/04/11/interactive_chart_nycs_budget_break.php)
PS. There's no good reason the display values can't include all the zeros. That's a lot easier than looking at things in thousands of millions. It doesn't do much to know that $296Mill of the city capital budget goes to police. Unless we know where that money is actually going, I have no idea what the point of the visualization is.

Unfortunately, Gothamist is a steady stream of "redesign exercises" --[Which NYC Government Agencies Are The Most Corrupt?](http://gothamist.com/2014/05/14/nyc_government_corruption.php) is a nice rundown of, if not the most corrupt agencies in the city, those agencies the city spends the most time investigating corruption complaints about. It's a nice start. And a nice way to start fishing for better stories, like *Why are there so many investigations in the School Construction Authority?*

Most of the charts in Dave Gilson's Mother Jones piece, [Can't Touch This](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/12/pentagon-budget-deal-charts-cuts) are pretty good. But holy bubbles, batman. That's the least helpful chart in there.

MaryJo Webster didn't put any charts in her report on opiate addiction,[Hooked on opiates: More legal use leads to more addiction, crimes, deaths](http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_22195739/hooked-opiates-more-legal-use-leads-more-addiction) but she did tap the DEA's "Automation of
Reports and Consolidated Orders System" also known as ARCOS in her reporting.
