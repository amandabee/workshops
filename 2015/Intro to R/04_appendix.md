File has a lot of options that we're not using in this current context. But https://class.coursera.org/rprog-015/lecture/127 does get at them.



I basically never use matrices. But that doesn't mean they aren't important.
```
m <- matrix(1:4, nrow=2 , ncol=2 )
dimnames(m) <- list(c("a", "b"), c("c", "d"))
m <- 1:20
dim(m) <- c(4, 5)
```
